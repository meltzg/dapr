  "Integration tests that exercise the real SMB code path — smb-nio / jcifs round
  trips against a live Samba server, the one thing the jimfs-backed unit tests
  cannot cover. Part of `clojure -M:integration` (not the hermetic default
  `clojure -X:test`).

  A :once fixture starts a guest + authenticated Samba server in a Docker container
  via Testcontainers, so there's no manual setup — a run needs only Docker, and the
  tests skip when it is unavailable. The container is bound to the host's port 445
  (jcifs ignores a non-default SMB port, so a random mapped port would not work);
  that port must be free."
