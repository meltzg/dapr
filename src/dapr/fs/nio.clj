  arbitrarily deep tree (or a symlink/junction cycle on a share, which gets no OS
  ELOOP protection) can't overflow the JVM stack. Opens each directory's stream
  explicitly (rather than via Files/walkFileTree) and notifies `on-scan` *before*
  the per-directory listing call -- which over MTP is a single blocking native
  round-trip -- making it possible to pinpoint a directory whose listing hangs (the
  last :dir event before the freeze names it). Reads one attribute set per entry,
  the same as Files/walkFileTree would.

  `on-scan`, when supplied, is called with:
    {:type :dir     :rel <dir rel path>} as each directory is *visited*, before its
                                         listing call (so the last :dir before a
                                         freeze names the directory whose listing
                                         hung over MTP);

                                         descends (n is its immediate child count);
    {:type :entry}                       for every child visited, advancing the
                                         done count toward the total;
    {:type :file    :track <track map>}  for each audio file found.
  Entries that fail to stat, and sub-directories that fail to open, are skipped
  (matching Files/walkFileTree's visitFileFailed=CONTINUE). If `on-scan` throws an
